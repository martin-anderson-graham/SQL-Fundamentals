1. Set up database

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE billing;

    CREATE TABLE customers(
      id serial PRIMARY KEY,
      name text NOT NULL,
      payment_token char(8) UNIQUE NOT NULL
        CHECK (payment_token ~ '^[A-Z]{8}$')
    );

    CREATE TABLE services(
      id serial PRIMARY KEY,
      description text NOT NULL,
      price numeric(10, 2) NOT NULL
        CHECK (price >= 0.0)
    );

    INSERT INTO customers(name, payment_token)
    VALUES ('Pat Johnson', 'XHGOAHEQ'),
          ('Nancy Monreal', 'JKWQPJKL'),
          ('Lynn Blake', 'KLZXWEEE'),
          ('Chen Ke-Hua', 'KWETYCVX'),
          ('Scott Lakso', 'UUEAPQPS'),
          ('Jim Pornot', 'XKJEYAZA');

    INSERT INTO services(description, price)
    VALUES ('Unix Hosting', 5.95),
          ('DNS', 4.95),
          ('Whois Registration', 1.95),
          ('High Bandwidth', 15.00),
          ('Business Support', 250.00),
          ('Dedicated Hosting', 50.00),
          ('Bulk Email', 250.00),
          ('One-to-one Training', 999.00);

    CREATE TABLE customers_services(
      id serial PRIMARY KEY,
      customer_id integer NOT NULL
        REFERENCES customers(id)
          ON DELETE CASCADE,
      service_id integer NOT NULL
        REFERENCES services(id),
      UNIQUE (customer_id, service_id)
    );

    INSERT INTO customers_services (customer_id, service_id)
    VALUES (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3),
          (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5),
          (6, 1), (6, 4),
          (7, 1), (7, 2), (7,6),
          (8, 1), (8, 6), (8, 7);
    ```

1. Write a query to retrieve the customer data for every customer who currently subscribes to at least one service.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT c.* FROM customers AS c
      JOIN customers_services AS sc
        ON sc.customer_id = c.id;
    ```

1. Write a query to retrieve the customer data for every customer who does not currently subscribe to any services.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT c.*, sc.* FROM customers AS c
      FULL OUTER JOIN customers_services AS sc
        ON sc.customer_id = c.id
      WHERE sc.service_id IS NULL OR sc.customer_id IS NULL;
    ```

    ```sql
    SELECT c.*, s.* FROM customers_services as cs
      FULL OUTER JOIN customers AS c
        ON c.id = cs.customer_id
      FULL OUTER JOIN services AS s
        ON s.id = cs.service_id
      WHERE cs.service_id IS NULL or cs.customer_id IS NULL;
    ```
1. Using RIGHT OUTER JOIN, write a query to display a list of all services that are not currently in use. Your output should look like this:

    ```sql
    SELECT s.description
      FROM customers_services AS cs
    RIGHT OUTER JOIN services AS s
        ON cs.service_id = s.id
    WHERE cs.customer_id IS NULL;
    ```

1. Write a query to display a list of all customer names together with a comma-separated list of the services they use. Your output should look like this:

    ```sql
    SELECT c.name, string_agg(s.description, ', ')
      FROM customers AS c
      LEFT OUTER JOIN customers_services as cs
        ON cs.customer_id = c.id
      LEFT OUTER JOIN services AS s
        ON cs.service_id = s.id
    GROUP BY c.name;
    ```

1. Write a query that displays the description for every service that is subscribed to by at least 3 customers. Include the customer count for each description in the report. The report should look like this:

    ```sql
    SELECT s.description, count(cs.customer_id) as "count"
      FROM services AS s
      JOIN customers_services AS cs
        ON cs.service_id = s.id
    GROUP BY s.description
    HAVING count(cs.customer_id) >= 3;
    ```

1. Assuming that everybody in our database has a bill coming due, and that all of them will pay on time, write a query to compute the total gross income we expect to receive.

    ```sql
    SELECT sum(s.price) AS gross
      FROM customers AS c
      JOIN customers_services AS cs
        ON cs.customer_id = c.id
      JOIN services AS s
        ON cs.service_id = s.id;
    ```

1. Add a new user

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO customers (name, payment_token)
    VALUES ('John Doe', 'EYODHLCN');

    INSERT INTO customers_services (customer_id, service_id)
    VALUES (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3);
    ```

1. The company president is looking to increase revenue. As a prelude to his decision making, he asks for two numbers: the amount of expected income from "big ticket" services (those services that cost more than $100) and the maximum income the company could achieve if it managed to convince all of its customers to select all of the company's big ticket items.

```sql
SELECT sum(price) 
  FROM customers_services AS cs
  JOIN services AS s
    ON cs.service_id = s.id
 WHERE price >= 100.0;

SELECT sum(price)
  FROM services
 CROSS JOIN customers
 WHERE price >= 100.0;
```

1. Write the necessary SQL statements to delete the "Bulk Email" service and customer "Chen Ke-Hua" from the database.

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM customers
    WHERE name = 'Chen Ke-Hua';

    DELETE FROM customers_services
    WHERE service_id = (SELECT id FROM services WHERE description = 'Bulk Email');

    DELETE FROM services 
    WHERE description = 'Bulk Email';
    ```
